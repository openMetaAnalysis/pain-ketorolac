Among patients with acute pain who can take oral medications, does parenteral ketorolac reduce pain more or faster than oral NSAIDs: Meta-analysis
============================================
A living systematic review

Short url: [https://openmetaanalysis.github.io/pain-ketorolac](https://openmetaanalysis.github.io/pain-ketorolac)

**Clinical summary:** This meta-analysis suggests that clinical intervention *is or is not* effective. Heterogeneity of results as measured by I<sup>2</sup> was '[moderate](https://training.cochrane.org/handbook/current/chapter-10#section-10-10-2)' at XX%. This review updates previously published meta-analysis(es).(citation[s] below)

<!--
Meta-regression of common modulators (year of publication, study size, event rate in the control groups) finds that the outcome of the intervention is effected by xx.
